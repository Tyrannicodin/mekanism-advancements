**Welcome to the (un)official community mekanism advancements!**

This project begun to put an end at the question why does mekanism have no advancements, we make and maintain the advancements so players can always expect the best and latest information ingame. These advancements were made with the idea that they were meant for both old and new players into mekanism, we enjoy the addition jokes & references to the tree since it makes it more enjoable :D

**What do you need to know for you to contribute?**<br>
That's a very simple question, you don't need any prior experiance into computer programming the only thing you need is a text editor some basic understanding of json concepts and that's it! Off you go adding your own advancements into this package.

**Is this associated with the mekanism developers?**<br>
No, this is a community project and as such we don't have any ties with the actual mod developers. If you are interested into the mekanism mod and haven't join their discord be sure to join it over here : https://discord.gg/nmSjMGc

**Do we have a discord?** <br>
No.

**Do you get credit for contributing?**
Well that depends on how much you contributed to the project for your name to show up in credits but you will always receive your credit but not on a personal note
