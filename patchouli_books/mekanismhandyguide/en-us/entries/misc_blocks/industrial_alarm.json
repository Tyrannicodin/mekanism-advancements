            "text": "The Industrial Alarm can be tied to anything that can output a redstone signal. For example, you want to trigger an alarm whenever your $(l:multiblocks/induction_matrix)Induction Matrix$(/l) is full. $(p)To do this, you will need to have a Redstone Comparator next to an $(l:misc_blocks/induction_port)Induction Port$(/l) and make sure that it is measuring the Matrix' capacity. In other words, have the side with two redstone torches be next to the port. $(p)Now place down 15 redstone dusts in between the comparator and the Industrion Alarm, and there you have it. Now when the Matrix is full, the Redstone Comparator will output a redstone signal strength of 15, thus triggering the alarm."
