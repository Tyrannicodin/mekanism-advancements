The capacity of a Induction Matrix is not based on the size of the multiblock, but rather how many Induction Cells are in it. The input and output rate of an Induction Matrix is defined by how many Induction Providers"

If you have two Basic Induction Providers (+256 kJ/t input/output rate each), then the total input/output rate will be 512 kJ/t."
